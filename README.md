Description: In this project, I dove into a large sales dataset to extract valuable insights.I explored sales trends over time, identify the best-selling products, calculate revenue metrics such as total sales and
profit margins, and create visualizations to present my findings effectively. 
This project showcases my ability to manipulate and derive insights from large datasets, enabling you to make data-driven recommendations for optimizing sales strategies.
